# EventCalendar

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an interactive ToDo list.  
The list also displays the current time and date upon refresh.
Each crated event is stored into local storage. 
Each event can be deleted and when done will be deleted from the Local Storage.
When tasks are completed, a line will strike through the completed item.  NOTE: whether or no items are completed will not be stored in the Local Storage yet.
To generate the time and date, Moment.js was used.
